NAME
    RT-Extension-Tags - Provides simple tagging using custom fields

DESCRIPTION
    This extension allows you to create tags using custom fields on tickets.
    RT has a custom field type that allows you to select multiple values
    with autocomplete from a list of values. This extension allows users to
    add new values (tags) that will then be added to the list of available
    autocomplete values for that custom field.

    The created tags become links to a search of all active tickets with
    that tag.

  Tag Custom Field
    The initdb step installs a Tag custom field by default along with the
    required condition, action, and scrip.

    If you want to use this functionality with a different custom field,
    create the custom field, then create a new scrip. You can use the
    provided "On Custom Field Change" condition as is. Then create a new
    action in the RT database using the same values as the provided "Add New
    CF Value" but change the Argument to the name of your new custom field.
    You can add this with a short initial data file, directly in the
    database, or using the helpful extension
    RT::Extension::AdminConditionsAndActions.
